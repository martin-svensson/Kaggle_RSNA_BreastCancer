# Kaggle_RSNA_BreastCancer

The competition is a notebook competition, so this repo is just for testing and developing code for the notebooks. 

It is just a heck of lot easier working with my local setup rather than directly in Kagge notebooks...

# Ressources

- Image classification in R: https://rpubs.com/Argaadya/image_conv 

# Learning

- Multiline commenting in Kaggle notebooks: ctrl + ' 
- It is not possible to feed a sparse pixel matrix to Keras (at least i cannot figure out how to do it...) 
- Use transfer learning: efficientnet etc. 
- See preprocessing notebook for how to do ROI extraction using imager
- When competitions are very computationally intensive (large amount of data on which we perform a lot of computations), R can be a real limitation (even though reticutlate works really well) 
- EDA library DataExplorer was very useful - highly recommend
- "Installing" libraries and packages in submission notebook when the competition does not allow internet: Install packages in a seperate notebook (with internet) and export enviornment (see Notebook "RSNA-Libs")
